					<span tid="p1020t011">Some modems need to be restarted before they will talk to a new router or an unfamiliar computer. And if there's a hiccup at your Internet Service Provider, the modem can drop your connection unexpectedly. We can see your modem but not the Internet, so giving it a quick restart will most likely do the trick.</span>
