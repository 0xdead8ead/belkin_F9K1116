			<p class="lead" tid="p1010t003">There should be a cable connecting your modem to the yellow port on your router. Your modem should be on.</p>
			<p tid="p1010t004">There are a few things you can do to make sure things are ready to go:</p>
			<ol>
				<li tid="p1010t005">Make sure your modem is turned on. Its power adapter should be plugged in at both ends, and one or more lights on the modem should be on.</li>
				<li tid="p1010t006">There should be a network cable connecting your modem to the yellow port on your router. This cable carries the signal from your modem to your router; without it, you can't get online.</li>
				<li tid="p1010t007">If these are both as they should be, you might try restarting your modem by unplugging its power supply, waiting fifteen seconds, then plugging it back in. If your modem has a battery you may need to find the modem's reset button and use that instead.</li>

					<span tid="p1010t010">The most common wiring difficulty is between the modem and the router. It's important to check both ends of the cable. One end should be plugged into the yellow port on your new router; the other end should be connected to a similar port on your modem. Different modem makers label the ports differently; you might find it labeled "data", "LAN", "network", or "Ethernet". </span>
