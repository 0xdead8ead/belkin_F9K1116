				<p tid="p1010MRt010">The most common wiring difficulty is between the modem and the router. It's important to check both ends of the cable. One end should be plugged into the yellow port on your new router; the other end should be connected to a similar port on your modem. Different modem makers label the ports differently; you might find it labeled "data", "LAN", "network", or "Ethernet". <span class="nub"></span></p>
