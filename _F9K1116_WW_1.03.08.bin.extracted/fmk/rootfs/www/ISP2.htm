DNS translates names like "belkin.com" into numeric addresses (IP addresses) that computers use to navigate the Internet. Your router has an IP address, which means it is connected to the Internet, and the DNS provided by your ISP is working, but we can't ping. This suggests that something is wrong at your ISP.</span>
