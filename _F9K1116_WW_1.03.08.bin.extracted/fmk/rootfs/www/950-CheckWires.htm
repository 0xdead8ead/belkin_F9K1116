					<span tid="p950t012">The most common setup issue is the wiring between the modem and the router. One end should be plugged into the yellow port on your new router; the other end should be plugged into a similar port on your modem. Make sure both are plugged in completely. Different modem makers label the ports differently; you might find it labeled "data", "LAN", "network", or "Ethernet".</span>
