h2='GLOSSARY OF TERMS';
h3='<b>Administrator</b> An administrator performs the service of maintaining a network. In the case of this Router, the person who sets up the Router and makes changes to the settings.';
h4='<b>Client</b> A computer on the network that uses the services of the Router, such as the automatic DHCP server and Firewall.';
d5='<b>DDNS</b> The DDNS service is very useful when combined with the "Virtual Server" feature (or DMZ feature). It allows Internet users to connect to your Virtual Servers (or DMZ PC) using a URL, rather than an IP Address.';
h5='<b>DHCP</b> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This protocol automatically configures the TCP/IP settings of every computer on your home network.';
h6='<b>Dial-Up</b> A connection which uses the public telephone network.';
h7='<b>DMZ</b> A virtual zone in the router that is not protected by the Router\'s firewall.  One computer can be placed in the DMZ.';
h8='<b>DNS Server Address</b> DNS stands for Domain Name System, which allows Internet host computers to have a domain name (such as belkin.com) and one or more IP addresses (such as 192.34.45.8). A DNS server keeps a database of host computers and their respective domain names and IP addresses, so that when a domain name is requested (as in typing "belkin.com" into your Internet browser), the user is sent to the proper IP address. The DNS server address used by the computers on your home network is the location of the DNS server your ISP has assigned.';
h9='<b>DSL Modem</b> DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. A DSL modem uses your existing phone lines to transmit data at high speeds.';
h10='<b>Dynamic IP</b> An IP address that is automatically obtained from a DHCP server.';
h11='<b>Ethernet</b> A standard for computer networks. Ethernet networks are connected by special cables and hubs, and move data around at up to 10 million bits per second (Mbps).';
h12='<b>Firewall</b> An electronic boundary that prevents unauthorized users from accessing certain files or computers on a network.';
h13='<b>Firmware</b> Software stored in memory. Essential programs that remain even when the system is turned off. Firmware is easier to change than hardware but more permanent than software stored on a disk.';
h14='<b>IP Address</b> IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address consists of a series of four numbers separated by periods, that identifies an single, unique Internet computer host. Example: 192.34.45.8.';
h15='<b>ISDN</b> Integrated Services Digital Network. Digital telecommunications lines that can transmit both voice and digital network services up to 128K, and are much faster and more reliable than high-speed analog modems. ISDN lines are offered by many telephone companies.';
h16='<b>ISP</b> Internet Service Provider. An ISP is a business that provides connectivity to the Internet for individuals and other businesses or organizations.';
h17='<b>ISP Gateway Address</b> (see ISP for definition). The ISP Gateway Address is an IP address for the Internet router located at the IS\'s office. This address is required only when using a cable or DSL modem.';
h18='<b>LAN</b> Local Area Network. A LAN is a group of computers and devices connected together in a relatively small area (such as a house or an office). Your home network is considered a LAN.';
h19='<b>MAC Address</b> MAC stands for Media Access Control. A MAC address is the hardware address of a device connected to a network.';
h20='<b>MTU</b> Maximum Transmission Unit. The largest unit of data that can be transmitted on any particular physical medium.';
h21='<b>NAT</b> Network Address Translation. This process allows all of the computers on your home network to use one IP address. Using the NAT capability of the HomeConnect home network gateway, you can access the Internet from any computer on your home network without having to purchase more IP addresses from your ISP.';
h22='<b>Port</b> A logical channel that is identified by its unique port number. Applications listen on specific ports for information that may be related to it.';
h23='<b>PPPoE</b> Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. Point-to-Point Protocol is a method of secure data transmission originally created for dial-up connections; PPPoE is for Ethernet connections.';
h24='<b>PPTP</b> Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. A version of PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) that has the ability to encapsulate packets of data formatted for one network protocol in packets used by another protocol. This tunneling technique allows TCP/IP data to be transmitted over a non-TCP/IP network. PPTP can be used to join different physical networks using the Internet as an intermediary.';
h25='<b>SNTP</b> Simple Network Time Protocol. A communication standard that allows for the transmission of real time information over a network or the Internet.';
h26='<b>SPI</b> Stateful Packet Inspection. SPI is the type of corporate-grade Internet security provided by your HomeConnect home network gateway. Using SPI, the gateway acts as a "firewall", protecting your network from computer hackers.';
h27='<b>Static IP</b> An IP address that is manually configured and never changes.';
h28='<b>Subnet Mask</b> A subnet mask, which may be a part of the TCP/IP information provided by your ISP, is a set of four numbers configured like an IP address. It is used to create IP address numbers used only within a particular network (as opposed to valid IP address numbers recognized by the Internet, which must assigned by InterNIC).';
h29='<b>TCP</b> Transmission Control Protocol. The most common Internet transport layer protocol. TCP is connection-oriented and stream-oriented, and provides for reliable communication over packet-switched networks.';
h30='<b>TCP/IP</b> Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol. This is the standard protocol for data transmission over the Internet.';
h31='<b>UDP</b> User Datagram Protocol. Communications protocol for the Internet network layer, transport layer, and session layer, which makes it possible to send a datagram message from one computer to an application running in another computer. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable communication; the application itself must process any errors and check for reliable delivery. ';
h32='<b>WAN</b> Wide Area Network. A network that connects computers located in geographically separate areas, (i.e., different buildings, cities, countries). The Internet is a wide area network.';
h33='<b>WAN IP Address</b> The IP address assigned to the router by the ISP.';
h34='<b>WLAN</b> Wireless Local Area Network. A local area network that connects computers close together via radio (such as 802.11b)';
h35="<b>L2TP</b> Layer Two (2) Tunneling Protocol. an extension to the PPP protocol that enables ISPs to operate Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). L2TP merges the best features of two other tunneling protocols: PPTP from Microsoft and L2F from Cisco Systems. Like PPTP, L2TP requires that the ISP's routers support the protocol.";
h39='<b>DHCP</b> The DHCP server function makes setting up a network very easy by assigning IP addresses to each computer on the network. The DHCP Server can be turned off if necessary. Turning off the DHCP server will require you to manually set a Static IP address in each computer on your network. The IP pool is the range of IP addresses set aside for dynamic assignment to the computers on your network. The default is 2-100 (99 computers) if you want to change this number, you can by entering a new starting and ending IP address and clicking on "Apply Changes".';

By typing in your WAN IP address from any computer on the Internet, you will be presented with a login screen where you need to type in the password of your router. The Second method is to allow a specific IP address only to remotely manage the router. This is more secure, but less convenient. To use this method, enter the IP address you know you will be accessing the Router from in the space provided and select "Only this IP address can remotely manage the Router". Before you enable this function, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you set your administrator password. Leaving the password empty will potentially open your router to intrusion. ';

g42='UPnP (Universal Plug-and-Play) is a technology that offers seamless operation of voice messaging, video messaging, games, and other applications that are UPnP compliant. Some applications require the Router\'s firewall to be configured in a specific way to operate properly. This usually requires opening TCP and UDP ports and in some instances setting trigger ports. An application that is UPnP compliant has the ability to communicate with the Router, basically "telling" the Router which way it needs the firewall configured. The Router ships with the UPnP feature enabled. If you are using any applications that are UPnP compliant, and wish to take advantage of the UPnP features, you can enable the UPnP feature. Simply select "Enable" in the "UPnP Enabling" section of the Utilities page. Click "Apply Changes" to save the change. ';

You can choose to download the new version or ignore it. The router ships with this feature disabled. If you want to enable it, select "Enable" and click "Apply Changes". ';

g46='Using Encryption can help secure your wireless network. Only one type of security may be selected at a time. Therefore the customer must select a mode that is supported on all network devices on the wireless network. This Belkin product has 4 possible Security settings:<br><br>1) Disabled. No encryption is enabled in this mode. Open networks where all users are welcome sometimes prefer not to enable encryption.<br><br>2) WPA/WPA2-Personal(PSK) (Wireless protected Access) PSK is a recent standards-based security technique where each packet of information is encrypted with a different code, or key. Since the key is constantly changing, WPA is very secure. WPA-PSK (Pre-shared Key) is for home and small business users who do not have a server. The PSK encryption key is generated automatically from a string of characters or Pass Phrase. Obviously, the biggest security risk in WPA PSK is if someone finds out your Pass Phrase.<br><br>a. TKIP verses AES. WPA setup requires the user to select whether to encrypt using TKIP or AES. The WPA standard specifies TKIP, so that is the default. Additionally TKIP should provide better compatibility between wireless products from different vendors since many wireless products will never be upgraded to AES. AES is a new encryption technique based on the un-ratified 802.11i standard. New WPA standards are being considered using AES. Although AES is not as popular, some users may prefer to use this technique. Either way, all networks devices must use the same technique.<br><br>b. Pre-shared Key. Enter any word or phrase up to 64 characters. The same PSK must also be used for every other wireless network device on the network. Watch out for upper and lower case differences ( "n" is different than "N"). Remember, the easiest way to break your security is for someone to guess your PSK.<br><br>3) 128-bit WEP. Until recently, 128-bit WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was the standard for wireless encryption. If not all of your wireless devices support WPA, 128bit WEP still offers very good security option. It will require you to enter hex numbers, or you can generate them automatically.<br><br>4) 64-bit WEP. Belkin only recommends 64-bit mode on networks where some devices do not support either WPA or 128bit WEP.';
