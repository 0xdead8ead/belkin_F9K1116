h2='GLOSSARY OF TERMS';  
h3='<b>Administrator</b> An administrator performs the service of maintaining a network. In the case of this Router, the person who sets up the Router and makes changes to the settings.';  
h4='<b>Client</b> A computer on the network that uses the services of the Router, such as the automatic DHCP server and Firewall.'; 
d5='<b>DDNS</b> The DDNS service is very useful when combined with the "Virtual Server" feature (or DMZ feature). It allows Internet users to connect to your Virtual Servers (or DMZ PC) using a URL, rather than an IP Address.'; 
h5='<b>DHCP</b> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This protocol automatically configures the TCP/IP settings of every computer on your home network.';  
h6='<b>Dial-Up</b> A connection which uses the public telephone network.'; 
h7='<b>DMZ</b> A virtual zone in the router that is not protected by the Router\'s firewall.  One computer can be placed in the DMZ.';   
h8='<b>DNS Server Address</b> DNS stands for Domain Name System, which allows Internet host computers to have a domain name (such as belkin.com) and one or more IP addresses (such as 192.34.45.8). A DNS server keeps a database of host computers and their respective domain names and IP addresses, so that when a domain name is requested (as in typing "belkin.com" into your Internet browser), the user is sent to the proper IP address. The DNS server address used by the computers on your home network is the location of the DNS server your ISP has assigned.';  
h9='<b>DSL Modem</b> DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. A DSL modem uses your existing phone lines to transmit data at high speeds.';  
h10='<b>Dynamic IP</b> An IP address that is automatically obtained from a DHCP server.';  
h11='<b>Ethernet</b> A standard for computer networks. Ethernet networks are connected by special cables and hubs, and move data around at up to 10 million bits per second (Mbps).';  
h12='<b>Firewall</b> An electronic boundary that prevents unauthorized users from accessing certain files or computers on a network.';  
h13='<b>Firmware</b> Software stored in memory. Essential programs that remain even when the system is turned off. Firmware is easier to change than hardware but more permanent than software stored on a disk.';  
h14='<b>IP Address</b> IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address consists of a series of four numbers separated by periods, that identifies an single, unique Internet computer host. Example: 192.34.45.8.';  
h15='<b>ISDN</b> Integrated Services Digital Network. Digital telecommunications lines that can transmit both voice and digital network services up to 128K, and are much faster and more reliable than high-speed analog modems. ISDN lines are offered by many telephone companies.';  
h16='<b>ISP</b> Internet Service Provider. An ISP is a business that provides connectivity to the Internet for individuals and other businesses or organizations.';  
h17='<b>ISP Gateway Address</b> (see ISP for definition). The ISP Gateway Address is an IP address for the Internet router located at the IS\'s office. This address is required only when using a cable or DSL modem.';  
h18='<b>LAN</b> Local Area Network. A LAN is a group of computers and devices connected together in a relatively small area (such as a house or an office). Your home network is considered a LAN.';  
h19='<b>MAC Address</b> MAC stands for Media Access Control. A MAC address is the hardware address of a device connected to a network.';  
h20='<b>MTU</b> Maximum Transmission Unit. The largest unit of data that can be transmitted on any particular physical medium.';  
h21='<b>NAT</b> Network Address Translation. This process allows all of the computers on your home network to use one IP address. Using the NAT capability of the router, you can access the Internet from any computer on your home network without having to purchase more IP addresses from your ISP.';  
h22='<b>Port</b> A logical channel that is identified by its unique port number. Applications listen on specific ports for information that may be related to it.';  
h23='<b>PPPoE</b> Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. Point-to-Point Protocol is a method of secure data transmission originally created for dial-up connections; PPPoE is for Ethernet connections.';  
h24='<b>PPTP</b> Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. A version of PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) that has the ability to encapsulate packets of data formatted for one network protocol in packets used by another protocol. This tunneling technique allows TCP/IP data to be transmitted over a non-TCP/IP network. PPTP can be used to join different physical networks using the Internet as an intermediary.';  
h25='<b>SNTP</b> Simple Network Time Protocol. A communication standard that allows for the transmission of real time information over a network or the Internet.';  
h26='<b>SPI</b> Stateful Packet Inspection. SPI is the type of corporate-grade Internet security provided by your router. Using SPI, the gateway acts as a "firewall," protecting your network from computer hackers.';  
h27='<b>Static IP</b> An IP address that is manually configured and never changes.';  
h28='<b>Subnet Mask</b> A subnet mask, which may be a part of the TCP/IP information provided by your ISP, is a set of four numbers configured like an IP address. It is used to create IP address numbers used only within a particular network (as opposed to valid IP address numbers recognized by the Internet, which must assigned by InterNIC).';  
h29='<b>TCP</b> Transmission Control Protocol. The most common Internet transport layer protocol. TCP is connection-oriented and stream-oriented, and provides for reliable communication over packet-switched networks.';  
h30='<b>TCP/IP</b> Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol. This is the standard protocol for data transmission over the Internet.';  
h31='<b>UDP</b> User Datagram Protocol. Communications protocol for the Internet network layer, transport layer, and session layer, which makes it possible to send a datagram message from one computer to an application running in another computer. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable communication; the application itself must process any errors and check for reliable delivery. '; 
h32='<b>WAN</b> Wide Area Network. A network that connects computers located in geographically separate areas, (i.e., different buildings, cities, countries). The Internet is a wide area network.';  
h33='<b>WAN IP Address</b> The IP address assigned to the router by the ISP.';  
h34='<b>WLAN</b> Wireless Local Area Network. A local area network that connects computers close together via radio (such as 802.11b)'; 
h35="<b>L2TP</b> Layer Two (2) Tunneling Protocol. an extension to the PPP protocol that enables ISPs to operate Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). L2TP merges the best features of two other tunneling protocols: PPTP from Microsoft and L2F from Cisco Systems. Like PPTP, L2TP requires that the ISP's routers support the protocol.";
